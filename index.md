Sure thing! We can definitely keep these artificial lobsters away from the realm of bionics if that's what you prefer. Here's an updated pitch:
Introducing: Grown Lobsters - Lobsters Grown, Not Caught
Our revolutionary Grown Lobsters are living, breathing artificial lobsters that are grown in a lab using the latest biotechnology. These lobsters are cultivated from lobster cells and do not require the cruel harvesting methods used for wild lobsters.
This means that you can enjoy the same delicious lobster experience without any of the environmental or ethical concerns associated with harvesting wild lobsters. And because our Grown Lobsters are cultivated in a controlled environment, they are always healthy and free from harmful contaminants.
Indulge in the luxurious taste of lobster with Grown Lobsters - the sustainable and ethical seafood of the future!
